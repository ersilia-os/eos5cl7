        "The authors curated a dataset of 282 compounds from ChEMBL",
        "of which 160 (56.7%) were labelled as active N. gonorrhoeae inhibitor compounds. They used this dataset to build a na\u00efve Bayesian model and used it to screen a commercial library. With this method",
        "they identified and validated two hits. We have used the dataset to build a model using Ersilia\u2019s set of AI modelling tools."
